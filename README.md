# TV Energy Consumption Visualisation

## ðŸ“Š Data Story
Our target audience includes **Australian consumers**, **policymakers**, and **sustainability advocates** who are interested in understanding how television technologies affect household energy consumption.  

Consumers are curious about **which TV technologies are common**, **how screen sizes affect energy use**, and **which brands dominate the market**. Policymakers and environmental organisations may use these insights to promote **energy efficiency awareness** and encourage **sustainable choices**.  

By presenting clear visualisations of the dataset, our project tells a story about the **trade-off between technology, screen size, and energy consumption**. This makes the information not only informative, but also actionable for decision-makers and everyday buyers.

## ðŸ“‘ About the data

### Data source
The dataset comes from the **Australian Governmentâ€™s energy rating register** of appliances, specifically televisions. It includes attributes such as **brand, model, screen size, screen technology, energy star rating, and power consumption**.

### Data processing
- Cleaned and standardised raw data for consistency.  
- Categorised TVs by **screen technology, screen size groups, and brands**.  
- Generated descriptive statistics and visualisations for six research questions:
  1. Available screen technologies and their frequencies.  
  2. Distribution of screen sizes.  
  3. Brands with the greatest number of models.  
  4. Power consumption by screen technology.  
  5. Relationship between screen size and power use.  
  6. Relationship between star rating and screen size.  

### Privacy
The dataset contains **only product-level specifications** (brand, model, energy rating). There is **no personal or sensitive information**.

### Accuracy and limitations
- Data reflects the products **registered** at the time of extraction, not necessarily every product available in stores.  
- Some manufacturer-reported data (like power consumption) may not always reflect **real-world usage**.  
- Analysis is limited to the attributes provided (does not include price or lifespan).  

### Ethics
The dataset is used strictly for **educational and research purposes**. No harm to individuals or organisations arises from its use. The focus is on **supporting sustainable energy practices** and **raising awareness** of energy-efficient technologies.

## ðŸ¤– AI Declaration
This project made use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to:  
- Generate and refine Python code for data cleaning and visualisation.  
- Draft explanations and supporting text for the visualisations.  
- Assist in writing project documentation such as this README.  

All AI-assisted outputs were **reviewed, verified, and adapted** by the project authors to ensure correctness, appropriateness, and academic integrity.
