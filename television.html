        <p>
            Televisions are one of the most common appliances in Australian homes â€” and one of the biggest contributors
            to household energy use. As screen sizes get larger and picture quality improves,
            energy consumption can rise dramatically if you are not careful.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Screen Size Matters:</strong> A 75-inch TV can use more than twice as much energy
            as a 55-inch model of similar technology. Consider the right size for your room and viewing distance
            before buying.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Technology Choice:</strong> OLED and LED televisions are generally more efficient
            than older plasma screens. Look for models with high star ratings under the
            <a href="https://www.energyrating.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Energy Rating Program</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Usage Habits:</strong> Energy consumption also depends on how long you watch TV.
            Try enabling power-saving modes, lowering brightness, and turning off the TV completely
            (not just leaving it on standby) when you are not watching.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our goal is to help you make smarter choices when buying and using televisions,
            saving you money on electricity bills while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
