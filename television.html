      <h1>Data Story: TV Energy Consumption</h1>
      <p class="lede">
        These visualisations summarise insights from our television energy dataset and show how design choices affect energy use.
        <strong>Question 1</strong> focuses on the Australian market subset, highlighting which screen technologies are most common locally.
        <strong>Questions 2–6</strong> are based on the full dataset, covering trends in screen size, brand variety, power consumption,
        and efficiency ratings across all entries in the dataset.

    <!-- Q1 -->
    <section class="q-section" id="q1">
      <h2>1) What type of TV screen technologies are currently available in Australia and which are the most frequent?</h2>
      <p>We compare counts of models by screen technology. The pie chart shows share, while the bar shows exact counts.</p>

          <figcaption>LCD (LED) accounts for the vast majority of models in the market.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Bar chart confirms the dominance of LCD (LED) vs standard LCD and OLED.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> LCD (LED) dominates availability; OLED and standard LCD are much less common.</div>
    </section>

    <!-- Q2 -->
    <section class="q-section" id="q2">
      <h2>2) What screen sizes are available, and which are most frequent?</h2>
      <p>Counts per screen-size category highlight the most common sizes consumers encounter in stores.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/Question2.png" alt="Counts by screen-size category (bar chart)" />
        <figcaption>Mid-to-large sizes (46–55&quot; and 56–65&quot;) are the most common in the dataset.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Australian shelves are led by 46–65 inch sets, matching current viewing preferences.</div>
    </section>

    <!-- Q3 -->
    <section class="q-section" id="q3">
      <h2>3) Which brands have the greatest number of different models?</h2>
      <p>This ranking shows which manufacturers offer the widest range of models.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/Question3.png" alt="Brands ranked by number of models (bar chart)" />
        <figcaption>Samsung Electronics, Kogan, and LG lead the market by model count.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The market is competitive, but a few brands dominate the product variety.</div>
    </section>

    <!-- Q4 -->
    <section class="q-section" id="q4">
      <h2>4) Which screen technology consumes the least power?</h2>
      <p>Median average-mode power is compared by technology to avoid distortion from extreme values.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/Question4.png" alt="Median average-mode power by technology (bar chart)" />
        <figcaption>Standard LCD has the lowest median power, followed by LCD (LED), then OLED.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> If energy use is your priority, standard LCDs tend to consume less in average mode.</div>
    </section>

    <!-- Q5 -->
    <section class="q-section" id="q5">
      <h2>5) What is the relationship between screen size and power use?</h2>
      <p>A scatter plot of size versus average-mode power shows how demand scales with area.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/Question5.png" alt="Scatter of screen size versus average-mode power" />
        <figcaption>Power generally rises with screen size; larger panels draw more power on average.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Bigger screens usually mean higher energy consumption, even within the same technology.</div>
    </section>

    <!-- Q6 -->
    <section class="q-section" id="q6">
      <h2>6) What is the relationship between star rating and screen size?</h2>
      <p>Plotting star ratings against sizes reveals how efficiency labels distribute across the range of sizes.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/Question6.png" alt="Scatter of star rating versus screen size" />
        <figcaption>High star ratings appear across many sizes; efficiency depends on model design rather than size alone.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Star rating and size are not tightly linked; shoppers should check the label for each model.</div>
