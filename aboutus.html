        <p>
            Energy Insight is an educational initiative designed to help Australians understand and reduce
            household energy consumption. We focus on practical, data-driven tips that can make a real difference.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project was built as a demonstration of modern web technologies —
            using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> — to create
            an interactive, easy-to-navigate website.
        </p>

            Our content is based on publicly available information from trusted sources such as the
            <a href="https://www.energyrating.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Energy Rating Program</a>
            by the Australian Government.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Our Mission:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Educate households on how energy ratings work.</li>
            <li>Encourage the purchase of energy-efficient appliances.</li>
            <li>Support Australia's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
