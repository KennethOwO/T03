        <p>
            This site helps you explore how appliances consume energy in Australian households.
            Learn how choosing energy-efficient products can save money and reduce environmental impact.
        </p>

        <p>
            Australia uses a national <strong>Energy Rating Label</strong> to help consumers compare
            the efficiency of products such as televisions, refrigerators, and air conditioners.
            The label shows a simple star rating — the more stars, the more efficient the appliance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Did you know that energy use by appliances and equipment accounts for
            nearly <strong>30% of the average Australian household electricity bill</strong>?
            Choosing energy-efficient appliances can save hundreds of dollars over the life of the product.
